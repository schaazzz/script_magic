title: Move Mouse to Active Window
author: Shahzeb Ihsan

I have a weird 3 screen setup at work:
...a docked laptop with a 27" monitor to its right and a 19" monitor *above* the 27" monitor.
 
I hate having to move the mouse from window to window when switching between windows using Alt-Tab, specially when the mouse has to be moved from the 1st screen to the 3rd screen.
 
So... I created this simple script to move the mouse to the middle of the new window if Alt-Tab is being used.
 
**Dependencies: pywin32, pyhook**

## How it works

{% highlight python %}
print "O HAI WORLD"
{% endhighlight %}

Ooga Booga...
